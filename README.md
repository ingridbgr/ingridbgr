👋 Hi y'all, I’m Ingrid 

<h2> About me </h2>

🤖 I’m a Brazilian Fullstack Developer that loves codes in python and all the Javascript frameworks and libraries <br>
🌱 I’m currently learning GO language and Docker - YOLO right? <br>
👾 Besides code I love to spend my time painting acquarelas and playing video game and table RPG 🧝‍♀️ <br>
📱 I also dedicate some of my spare time to help Brazilian people to start in the code world by giving tips and advices on my instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/in.codes/">@in.codes</a> (check it out!) <br>
